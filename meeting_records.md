Project Goal - train an AI model to be able to detect links between specific genes in the human genome and particular diseases.

This will be done by training a model on GWAS data, at first building on top of existing models and then moving to an independent model. The model can be trained by giving it access to a smaller sample of data than is available in the study. For example, giving it 3k data points rather than the full 30k data points in the study to see if the model can spot the patterns of association on a smaller sample size.

My role in this project will be more on the biology side of things; extracting data from studies, trying to spot patterns in the literature, helping to train the model on extracting data from the literature.
